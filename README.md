Usability The landing page is designed to be fully usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. The responsive design ensures that all features and content are accessible and well-displayed on different screen sizes.

Styling Styling has been added for active states, allowing users to easily identify the active section or navigation item. This visual cue enhances the user experience and provides clear feedback.

HTML Structure The landing page consists of at least four sections that have been added to the page. These sections are strategically placed to organize and present content effectively.

Landing Page Behavior Navigation The navigation menu is built dynamically as an unordered list. The project starts with an empty

element and dynamically generates the navigation using the Append, appendChild, and innerHTML methods. This approach ensures flexibility and scalability when adding or modifying sections.
Section Active State While scrolling through the landing page, it is clear which section is being viewed. The active section is highlighted, enabling users to easily track their position and understand the page structure.

Scroll to Anchor When clicking on an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section on the page. This behavior enhances navigation and improves the overall user experience.

Documentation The project includes a README.md file that provides information about the project. The README file follows the markdown syntax and contains essential details such as the project description, usage instructions, dependencies, and any other relevant information for running or understanding the project.
